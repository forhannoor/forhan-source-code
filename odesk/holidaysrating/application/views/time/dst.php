<p>Daylight saving time (DST) —also summer time in British English— is the practice of advancing clocks during the lighter months so that evenings have more apparent daylight and mornings have less. 
Typically clocks are adjusted forward one hour near the start of spring and are adjusted backward in autumn.</p>
