<p><?php echo anchor('time/eat', 'East Africa Time (EAT)') ?>, is a time zone used in Eastern <?php echo anchor('regions/africa', 'Africa') ?>. The zone is three hours ahead of <?php echo anchor('time/utc', 'Coordinated Universal Time') ?> (UTC+3), which is the same as Arabia Standard Time, and also the same as Eastern European Summer Time.
<br /><br />
As this Time Zone is predominantly in the equatorial region, there is no significant change in day length throughout the year, so daylight saving time is not observed.</p>
