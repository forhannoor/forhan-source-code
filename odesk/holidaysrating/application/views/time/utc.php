<p>Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time. 
It is one of several closely related successors to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). 
For most purposes, UTC is synonymous with GMT, but GMT is no longer precisely defined by the scientific community.</p>
